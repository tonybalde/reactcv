# React CV App

Live demo at: [[DevCV App]](https://devcv.vercel.app/)
### If you are beginner Dev, and want a free template to build your CV, this is the App! 

## How it works?
1. Click in the item you want to edit, and write the new value (text).
2. Click outside the input (when you edited the previous value with the new one) or press Enter to save the new value.
3. Click "Add.." button in Projects, Work Experience or Education titles, below the example (you can edit the example) to add a new item of these section. Also you can remove the last item added in each section by clicking in the "Remove..." button.
4. Click on the date you want to edit with the new value and save it like with the preview items.
5. Click on the "Printer Icon" below the instruccions on the left, so you can print your CV or save it as a PDF file (you have to choose this option instead of your default printer).

Here you have a short video tutorial how to use the App, 
just click in the imagen preview of app below:

## TODO: 
1. In later reviews, I want to build a button (I've tried but didn't work)to save the PDF file (similar to the print button) where you can see the clickable links to your Github or LinkedIn profile and your projects live demo and repo urls. So when
you click in one of those links, a browser will open and shows that web.
2. Remove the header and the footer info in the .pdf file, so it's more clean and similar to a real cv.
3. Improve compatibility with Chrome (I test it in Brave and Edge and worked fine).
4. Make it responsive.

## Thanks for checking this out!
